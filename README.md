# Mildew Detection in Cherry Leaves

This project applies data science and machine learning to distinguish between healthy and diseased cherry leaves. Users can upload images through a Streamlit dashboard to predict leaf health. Alongside the model, the project includes insights from traditional data analysis, hypothesis evaluation, and model performance assessment.

To keep things organized and efficient, the project is structured around three Jupyter notebooks: one for data import and cleaning, one for data visualization, and another for developing and evaluating a TensorFlow deep learning model. This setup ensures a smooth workflow from data processing to model deployment.

The goal is to help an agri-food business tackle a powdery mildew infestation in its cherry tree plantations. Right now, trees are inspected manuallyâ€”a slow and labor-intensive process. By automating detection through machine learning, this solution can save time and improve accuracy, making it easier to identify and treat infected trees quickly.

The project is hosted on the streamlit app and a live version may be found [here](https://milestone-project-mildew-detection-in-0b9a.onrender.com)

## Dataset Content

- The dataset is sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/codeinstitute/cherry-leaves). We then created a fictitious user story where predictive analytics can be applied in a real project in the workplace.
- The dataset contains +4 thousand images taken from the client's crop fields. The images show healthy cherry leaves and cherry leaves that have powdery mildew, a fungal disease that affects many plant species. The cherry plantation crop is one of the finest products in their portfolio, and the company is concerned about supplying the market with a compromised quality product.

## Business Requirements

The cherry plantation crop from Farmy & Foods is facing a challenge where their cherry plantations have been presenting powdery mildew. Currently, the process is manual verification if a given cherry tree contains powdery mildew. An employee spends around 30 minutes in each tree, taking a few samples of tree leaves and verifying visually if the leaf tree is healthy or has powdery mildew. If there is powdery mildew, the employee applies a specific compound to kill the fungus. The time spent applying this compound is 1 minute. The company has thousands of cherry trees located on multiple farms across the country. As a result, this manual process is not scalable due to the time spent in the manual process inspection.

To save time in this process, the IT team suggested an ML system that detects instantly, using a leaf tree image, if it is healthy or has powdery mildew. A similar manual process is in place for other crops for detecting pests, and if this initiative is successful, there is a realistic chance to replicate this project for all other crops. The dataset is a collection of cherry leaf images provided by Farmy & Foods, taken from their crops.

- 1 - The client is interested in conducting a study to visually differentiate a healthy cherry leaf from one with powdery mildew.
- 2 - The client is interested in predicting if a cherry leaf is healthy or contains powdery mildew.

## Hypothesis and Validation Approach

### Hypothesis

Infected cherry leaves can be visually identified due to a distinct powdery white layer on their surface.

### Validation Steps

1. **Data Collection**  
   - Gather an image dataset of healthy and infected leaves from the client.  

1. **Visual Inspection**  
   - Create an image montage to compare healthy and infected leaves, highlighting key differences.  

1. **Testing with Image Analysis**  
   - Perform an average image analysis to identify consistent patterns or visual features that distinguish infected leaves from healthy ones.

## The rationale to map the business requirements to the Data Visualisations and ML tasks

### Business Requirement 1

The study should include analysis on:  

- **Average and variability images** for each class (healthy or powdery mildew).  
- **Differences between average healthy and average powdery mildew cherry leaves** to highlight distinguishing features.  
- **An image montage** for each class to provide a visual reference.  

### Business Requirement 2

- The ML system should **predict whether a cherry leaf is healthy or infected with powdery mildew**.  
- The dashboard should include:  
  - **An image montage feature** for visual comparison.  
  - **A prediction feature** that allows users to upload an image and receive a classification result.  

## ML Business Case

- In the previous bullet, you potentially visualised an ML task to answer a business requirement. You should frame the business case using the method we covered in the course.

## Dashboard Design

- List all dashboard pages and their content, either blocks of information or widgets, like buttons, checkboxes, images, or any other items, that your dashboard library supports.
- Finally, during the project development, you may revisit your dashboard plan to update a given feature (for example, at the beginning of the project, you were confident you would use a given plot to display an insight, but later, you chose another plot type).
