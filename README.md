# Mildew Detection in Cherry Leaves

![Am I responsive](assets/am_i_responsive_mildew.png)

This project applies data science and machine learning to distinguish between healthy and diseased cherry leaves. Users can upload images through a Streamlit dashboard to predict leaf health. Alongside the model, the project includes insights from traditional data analysis, hypothesis evaluation, and model performance assessment.

To keep things organized and efficient, the project is structured around three Jupyter notebooks: one for data import and cleaning, one for data visualization, and another for developing and evaluating a TensorFlow deep learning model. This setup ensures a smooth workflow from data processing to model deployment.

The goal is to help an agri-food business tackle a powdery mildew infestation in its cherry tree plantations. Right now, trees are inspected manuallyâ€”a slow and labor-intensive process. By automating detection through machine learning, this solution can save time and improve accuracy, making it easier to identify and treat infected trees quickly.

The project is hosted on the streamlit app and a live version may be found [here](https://milestone-project-mildew-detection-in-0b9a.onrender.com/)

## Dataset Content

- The dataset is sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/codeinstitute/cherry-leaves). We then created a fictitious user story where predictive analytics can be applied in a real project in the workplace.
- The dataset contains +4 thousand images taken from the client's crop fields. The images show healthy cherry leaves and cherry leaves that have powdery mildew, a fungal disease that affects many plant species. The cherry plantation crop is one of the finest products in their portfolio, and the company is concerned about supplying the market with a compromised quality product.

## Business Requirements

The cherry plantation crop from Farmy & Foods is facing a challenge where their cherry plantations have been presenting powdery mildew. Currently, the process is manual verification if a given cherry tree contains powdery mildew. An employee spends around 30 minutes in each tree, taking a few samples of tree leaves and verifying visually if the leaf tree is healthy or has powdery mildew. If there is powdery mildew, the employee applies a specific compound to kill the fungus. The time spent applying this compound is 1 minute. The company has thousands of cherry trees located on multiple farms across the country. As a result, this manual process is not scalable due to the time spent in the manual process inspection.

To save time in this process, the IT team suggested an ML system that detects instantly, using a leaf tree image, if it is healthy or has powdery mildew. A similar manual process is in place for other crops for detecting pests, and if this initiative is successful, there is a realistic chance to replicate this project for all other crops. The dataset is a collection of cherry leaf images provided by Farmy & Foods, taken from their crops.

- 1 - The client is interested in conducting a study to visually differentiate a healthy cherry leaf from one with powdery mildew.
- 2 - The client is interested in predicting if a cherry leaf is healthy or contains powdery mildew.

## Hypothesis and Validation Approach

### Hypothesis 1

Infected cherry leaves can be visually identified due to a distinct powdery white layer on their surface.

### Validation

1. **Data Collection**  
   - Gather an image dataset of healthy and infected leaves from the client.  

1. **Visual Inspection**  
   - Create an image montage to compare healthy and infected leaves, highlighting key differences.  

1. **Testing with Image Analysis**  
   - Perform an average image analysis to identify consistent patterns or visual features that distinguish infected leaves from healthy ones.

### Hypothesis 2

An ML system trained on cherry leaf images can accurately predict that a cherry leaf is healthy or infected with mildew with at least 90% accuracy.

### Validation

This has been verified through the ML Prediction Metrics which show 99% accuracy.

## The rationale to map the business requirements to the Data Visualisations and ML tasks

### Business Requirement 1

The study should include analysis on:  

- **Average and variability images** for each class (healthy or powdery mildew).  
- **Differences between average healthy and average powdery mildew cherry leaves** to highlight distinguishing features.  
- **An image montage** for each class to provide a visual reference.  

### Business Requirement 2

- The ML system should **predict whether a cherry leaf is healthy or infected with powdery mildew**.  
- The dashboard should include:  
  - **An image montage feature** for visual comparison.  
  - **A prediction feature** that allows users to upload an image and receive a classification result.  

## ML Business Case

The client has requested a solution that will enable them to quickly and efficiently differentiate between healthy & diseased leaves. This will be done by creating a ML model.

The aim behind the ML task is to develop a ML model that is able to distinguish between a healthy cherry leaf and one infected with powdery mildew.

To do this, we will create an ML model which can predict if a leaf is infected or not. This will then indicate if the tree in question should be recommended for treatment.

We may consider this successful if it is capable of achieving an accuracy rating of at least 97% on the test dataset. lower than 97% will be considered a failure. A high accuracy rating is essential to avoid serious economic implications for the client.

The  ML model should be consistantly reliable while the available montages and comparisons offer visual reference for users.

Successful creation and application will improve the accuracy and speed of detecting powdery mildew, leading to reduced reliance on manual labor, cost savings, enhanced productivity, and increased worker safety by minimizing exposure to potential environmental hazards.

## Dashboard Design

### Quick Project Summary

General Information

Powdery mildew, caused by Podosphaera clandestina, is an obligate biotrophic fungus that affects sweet and sour cherry trees. Mid- and late-season sweet cherry cultivars (Prunus avium) are particularly vulnerable to this disease, rendering the fruit unmarketable due to the white fungal growth that appears on the surface of the cherries.

Initial symptoms of powdery mildew typically appear 7 to 10 days after the first irrigation. These symptoms include light, roughly circular, powdery patches on the young, susceptible leaves, which are newly unfolded and light green in color. Older leaves, however, develop an age-related resistance to powdery mildew, making them less prone to infection.

Unlike many other fungi, powdery mildews do not require free water for germination. However, fungal growth and germination are favored by high humidity levels, as noted by Grove & Boal (1991a).

The current method of manually inspecting cherry trees for signs of powdery mildew has been deemed time-inefficient. To address this challenge, the client has requested the development of a Machine Learning (ML) model that can predict, based on uploaded photographs, whether a given cherry leaf shows signs of infection.
